\details{
Traits included are percent winter survival for 1992-3, 1993-4,
1994-5, 1997-8, and 1999-2000 (surv92, surv93, surv94, surv97, surv99,
respectively), and days to flowering after no vernalization (flower0),
4 weeks vernalization (flower4) or 8 weeks vernalization
(flower8). Percents are of plants alive in the Fall, taken from the
middle of rows (totals unavailable). Days to flowering after
transplant are averages over four replicates from a RCB design (values
by block unavailable). First column has the trait name. The remaining
columns identify individual DH line (302-455). 

Marker genotype data for Major x Stellar double haploid (DH)
population. Double haploids have the same relation of recombination to
distance as backcrosses as there is just one meiosis tracked (in
F1). However, DH are homozygous at every locus (usually mapped as RI0
lines). Marker genotypes are coded as M = Major, S = Stellar, - =
missing. Data columns are
\code{chrom} = B. napus chromosome (N1, N2, etc.);
\code{order} = along chromosome;
\code{cM} = istance from proximal end;
\code{marker} = marker name
(E = AFLP;
 *ec, *tg, *wg = RFLP;
 *xxx = other markers from Arabidopsis:
Lem, eru1, eru2, fad3, isoDia, isoIdh, isoPgi, isoLap, pr2, slg6, Aca1, cor15).
Remaining columns are for individual DH lines (identifier 302-455).
